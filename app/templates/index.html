        The US Disease Tracker monitors three vaccine-preventable diseases—measles, invasive meningococcal disease, and pertussis (also known as whooping cough)—across the United States. Cases are tracked at the county or state level, with detailed statistics and visualizations available to capture disease transmission patterns over time and in the past two weeks. Cases are also reported by age group to illustrate which populations are most affected by these diseases. We are working to expand the tracker to include data on additional diseases in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data included in this dashboard can be used to inform policy decisions and guide public health communications. This resource serves as a reliable source of information on selected vaccine-preventable diseases for members of the public, health care providers, and the public health practice community.
